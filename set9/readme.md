TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week we had our Programming quiz during our tutorial session so we were not able to move on with our lecture content but I did some revision on Pandas and Maps to better familiarize myself for next week. I also attempted the exercises in Set 5 in advance.
