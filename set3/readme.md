Code reading experience:
In my opinion, the code written by Rizo007 has the best readability as it is short, simple and easy to understand. However in terms of performance, it has a worst time complexity of O(n^2), which may not have the quickest run time. I also think that AkisukeY has a better solution as he uses descriptive variables and builds the pyramid step by steps.

On the other hand, although the code written by TerryAg and matthewpoytress are short, it has bad readability and does not include any descriptive variables and comments which are hard to understand
