This week's vocabulary words that I learnt are:
1. calling - instructing the program to execute the code within that function.
2. argument - values passed to a function or method when called or invoked
3. function - a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task
4. variable - a named storage location that holds a value
5. iterate - the process of repeat and executing a set of instructions or operations (looping)
6. interface -  refers to a programming construct that defines a contract or a set of rules for how a component or module should interact with other components or modules

This week I learnt how to apply the basic programming concepts into Python such as doing mathematical questions, converting strings to uppercase and using lists. I currently do not have any topics that I am unclear on.
