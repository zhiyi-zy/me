TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week we learned about what programming is and did some basic coding and programming in Python. We also completed our set up for the course during this week's lab. I am still a little bit unclear on how git works and initially struggled with running the tests for exercise 1 but I was able to overcome my problems with the help of other students and Stack Overflow.

I have also completed the trinket task by making the first letter of my name (Z) with a turtle, here is the link:
