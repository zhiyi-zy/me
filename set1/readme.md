TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week we learned about what programming is and did some exercises on programming in Python. We also completed our set up for the course during this week's lab. I am still a little bit unclear on how git works and if I am doing the right thing or not but I am glad that stack overflow helped me overcome some of my problems.
